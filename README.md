# Music-Recommendation-DecisionTree-Algorithm

In recent years there has been an enormous growth in music streaming services and many major companies have started their own music streaming services. With increasing number of users, a lot of attention goes into personalizing the content delivered to each user. With more and more songs being added to the library, it is becoming difficult to produce precise results. Music recommendation systems are still in their early stages because of the number of factors, which affect the userâ€™s choice to listen to a particular song, and the emotional value attached to songs. The decision tree is one of the most powerful and popular algorithms. Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables. It allows us to analyse completely the possible consequences of a decision.
